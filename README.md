## 🛠️ For Developers

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lifan-builds/perks-reminder.git
cd perks-reminder
npm install
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev
```

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes + Server Actions  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon main + Neon dev branch)
- **ORM:** Prisma with generated client
- **Auth:** NextAuth.js (Google OAuth)

> **📄 Complete Documentation:** See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for detailed system architecture, development guidelines, and implementation details.

### Testing
```bash
npm test   # Jest: unit, API routes, server actions, component tests
```

### Database Environments (Dev + Prod)

Perks Reminder uses Neon PostgreSQL with two URLs:

- `DATABASE_URL` = production (Neon main branch)
- `DATABASE_URL_DEV` = development branch (safe for testing migrations)

Use this workflow:

```bash
# 1) Verify target before any DB command
node scripts/check-database-connection.js

# 2) Run migrations on dev first
DATABASE_URL="$DATABASE_URL_DEV" npx prisma migrate deploy

# 3) Verify migration state on dev
DATABASE_URL="$DATABASE_URL_DEV" npx prisma migrate status

# 4) Apply to prod only when ready
DATABASE_URL="$DATABASE_URL" npx prisma migrate deploy

# 5) Verify migration state on prod
DATABASE_URL="$DATABASE_URL" npx prisma migrate status
```

Troubleshooting and safety notes are documented in `docs/safe-migration-guide.md`.
